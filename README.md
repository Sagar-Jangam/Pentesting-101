# Pentesting 101

I am sometimes asked the question "how to start in Penetration Testing/ Bug Bounty" and I feel speechless as I am not sure where to point a beginner  as there aren't many resources which wont confuse the help out a beginner. I understand the struggle new comers go through because I too went through the same when I was beginning in the security space. Back then I only wished somebody could tell me what to do, how to start and, what skills to gather. I am thus writing this guide to help new comers in the field, this guide is suitable for both students and working professionals. I am going to list some of the topics to learn, methodology to practice, some Dos and Don'ts. So let's begin: 

A beginner may sometimes be over whelmed by the breadth \(as well as depth\) of the field, but don't let this discourage you, always remind yourself that the same immensity also means the field will always have opportunities for new comers. Due to the immensity of the space, becoming an expert would take some time and a lot of knowledge. I am segregating the guide into three levels, Basics, Intermediate, and expert level. Best way to learn something is to start with the basics. However feel free to skip something if you are already aware or if confident enough.
