# Pentesting 101

I am sometimes asked the question "how to start in Penetration Testing/ Bug Bounty" and I feel speechless as I am not sure where to point a beginner as there aren't many resources that won't confuse the help out a beginner. I understand the struggle newcomers go through because I too went through the same when I was beginning in the security space. Back then I only wished somebody could tell me what to do, how to start and, what skills to gather. I am thus writing this guide to help newcomers in the field, this guide is suitable for both students and working professionals. I am going to list some of the topics to learn, methodology to practice, some Dos and Don'ts. So let's begin:

A beginner may sometimes be overwhelmed by the breadth \(as well as depth\) of the field, but don't let this discourage you, always remind yourself that the same immensity also means the field will always have opportunities for newcomers. Due to the immensity of the space, becoming an expert would take some time and a lot of knowledge. I am segregating the guide into three levels, Basics, Intermediate, and expert level. The best way to learn something is to start with the basics. However, feel free to skip something if you are already aware of, or if confident enough.
