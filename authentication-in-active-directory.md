# Authentication in Active Directory

Most authentication mechanisms can be broken down into the following: 

* A user who varifies its identity by providing some they have, something they are, something they know, or a combination of these \(username, password, and an MFA\)
* A system that accepts user's input and performs verification with data stored corresponding to the user
* A database that stores user information

We will try to understand the AD authentication/ authorization with regards to above these components

The usual workflow of a user in an AD environment involves accessing a workstation, accessing some service, making some changes, and at last saving the changes. All these require some kind of authentication and/or authorization, and the access is facilitated via different means in AD.

Let us go through various means of authentication/ authorization in an AD

User, LSASS, offline access, online access, password change
