# Authentication in Active Directory

Most authentication mechanisms can be broken down into the following: 

* A user who varifies its identity by providing some they have, something they are, something they know, or a combination of these \(username, password, and an MFA\)
* A system that accepts user's input and performs verification with data stored corresponding to the user
* A database that stores user information

We will try to understand the AD authentication/ authorization with regards to above these components

The usual workflow of a user in an AD environment involves accessing a workstation, accessing some service, making some changes, and at last saving the changes. All these require some kind of authentication and/or authorization, and the access is facilitated via different means in AD.

Let us go through various means of authentication/ authorization in an AD

**Workstation**: 

There are two scenarios while a user is attempting to authenticate to a domain-joined workstation with a domain user 

* Online: 
  * a workstation is online and the authentication is verified with the AD
  * user inputs credentials into the logon UI
  * Credential Manager accepts the creds
  * creds are checked against the DC
* Offline: 
  * a workstation is offline and the authentication is facilitated by the Cache
  * user inputs the creds in logon UI
  * Credential Manager accepts the creds 
  * creds are checked against the Cache
