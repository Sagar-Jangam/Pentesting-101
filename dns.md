# DNS

**DNS**: Domain Name System

* Humans cant remember IP addresses, they can remember names 
* Machines communicate using IP addresses 
* Thus a system to translate Names to IP and via-a-versa

This is how a Name is resolved to IP addresses \(consider pi.co\)

* On a request to translate a name to an IP address 
* The machine checks its Cache \(hosts files\), if the entry is present, resolved IP is provided  
* The machine checks with the recursive DNS server \(usually hosted by ISPs\). The recursive server are responsible for providing the IP address for the requested name. 
* The recursive server checks the name at its local files, if not found, it contacts the root server. 
* The root server responds back with the IP for the TLD server
* The recursive server then send the resolution request to the TLD server 
* TLD server responses with the authoritative server for the domain name 
* Recursive server then sends the request to authoritative server
* The authoritative server responds back with the name server for the domain
* Recursive server queries the Name server for the domain
* The Name server for the domain finally shares the IP address corresponding to the domain.

| Resolve pi.co  | → | I don't have pi.co, hold on |   |   |
|   |   | Do you have pi.co  | → | **Root Server**: No I don't |
|   |   |   | ← | I have co, here it is  |
|   |   | Hi Co, do you have pi.co  | → | Co Server: No I don't |
|   |   |   | ← | I have NS for pi.co |
|   |   | Hi NS, do you have pi.co | → | Sure I do |
|   |   |   | ← | here is pi.co |
| Thanks | ← | Here is pi.co |   |   |
