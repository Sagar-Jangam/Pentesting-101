# Network

**IP Address**: A host/node identification address, network dependent, assigned to a device on a successful connection, may change with the change in network or even in case of re-connection. Example: **172.32.1.2**

**MAC Address**: A hardware identification address, bound with the hardware itself, globally unique, usually constant for a device unless the internal hardware is changed. Example: **ab:cd:ef:12:34:56**

**NIC**: Network Interface Card, the hardware component which facilitates a connection with the network. This is what is burned permanently with a MAC address. 

A device might have multiple NICs thus multiple MAC address. Additionally, a device may have multiple IP addresses depending upon the number of network it is connected to.

**IP Classes**: IP addresses are classified on the bases of the octets reserved for Networks and Hosts identification. Example: 192.168.11.2 is a Class C IP address where the first three octets are used for identifying the network whereas the last octet for identifying the host. 

**CIDR**: A classless representation to identifying the network and the host. Example: 192.168.12.3/24 implies that the first 24 bits are reserved for network and last 8 bits for the host.

**Subnet Mask**: An IP used for identifying a section of a subnet, this is not coupled with a device/ host instead a network. An IP address along with Subnet mask can be used to identify the host and network, and alternative to CIDR. Example: 255.255.255.0 implies the first three octets are reserved for identifying the network and the last for hosts. 

Let's use a scenario to move further, this time, a simple communication between two friends Alice and Bob.

Alice wants to send a message to Bob and they are both in a local network with the following configuration. 

| **Alice's Machine** | **Bob's Machine** |
| :--- | :--- |
| IP: 192.168.0.2 | IP: 192.168.0.3 |
| MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA | MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB |

To communicate in a network machines need to know each other's MAC address, this is how MACs are communicated: 

* Alice, types Bob's name with some command directing the machine to start a communication with Bob's machine
* Alice's machine then resolves Bob's name to an IP address via Cache, DNS, etc.
* Alice now broadcasts a message requesting all machines to identify themselves if they are at Bob's IP address
  * Source MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA 
  * Destination MAC: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 
  * Data: “Who has 192.168.0.3? Tell 192.168.0.2!
* Any machine in the network, by default ignores messages which are not intended for them i.e. ignoring the messages which aren't marked with their MAC. Alice then adds a broadcast MAC ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff to the message which all machines accept and then respond accordingly. 
* Bob gets the message and informs Alice with his MAC. 
  * Source MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB 
  * Destination MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA 
  * Data: “192.168.0.3 is at BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB!”
* Alice and Bob now have each other's MAC which they save in their local Caches
* After exchanging the MACs, Alice and Bob can now communicated with each other directly.

This exercise of finding MAC of each other's machine is knows as **Address Resolution Protocol**. Post the resolution the communication between the two machines starts.
