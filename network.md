# Network

**IP Address**: A host/node identification address, network dependent, assigned to a device on a successful connection, may change with the change in network or even in case of re-connection. Example: **172.32.1.2**

**MAC Address**: A hardware identification address, bound with the hardware itself, globally unique, usually constant for a device unless the internal hardware is changed. Example: **ab:cd:ef:12:34:56**

**NIC**: Network Interface Card, the hardware component which facilitates a connection with the network. This is what is burned permanently with a MAC address. 

A device might have multiple NICs thus multiple MAC address. Additionally, a device may have multiple IP addresses depending upon the number of network it is connected to.

Let's use a scenario to understand further, this time, a simple communication between two friends Alice and Bob.
