# Network

**IP Address**: A host/node identification address, network dependent, assigned to a device on a successful connection, may change with the change in network or even in case of re-connection. Example: **172.32.1.2**

**MAC Address**: A hardware identification address, bound with the hardware itself, globally unique, usually constant for a device unless the internal hardware is changed. Example: **ab:cd:ef:12:34:56**

**NIC**: Network Interface Card, the hardware component which facilitates a connection with the network. This is what is burned permanently with a MAC address. 

A device might have multiple NICs thus multiple MAC address. Additionally, a device may have multiple IP addresses depending upon the number of network it is connected to.

Let's use a scenario to understand further, this time, a simple communication between two friends Alice and Bob.

Alice wants to send a message to Bob and they are both in a local network with the following configuration. 

| **Alice's Machine** | **Bob's Machine** |
| :--- | :--- |
| IP: 192.168.0.2 | IP: 192.168.0.3 |
| MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA | MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB |

To communicate in a network machines need to know each other's MAC address. To find out the MAC and then to send the message this is what happens: 

* Alice, types Bob's name with some command directing the machine to start a communication with Bob's machine
* Alice's machine then resolves Bob's name to an IP address via Cache, DNS, etc.
* Alice now broadcasts a message requesting all machines to identify themselves if they are at Bob's IP address
  * Source MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA 
  * Destination MAC: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 
  * Data: “Who has 192.168.0.3? Tell 192.168.0.2!
* Any machine in the network, by default ignores messages which are not intended for them i.e. ignoring the messages which aren't marked with their MAC. Alice then adds a broadcast MAC ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff to the message which all machines accept and then respond accordingly. 
* Bob gets the message and informs Alice with his MAC. 
  * Source MAC: BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB 
  * Destination MAC: AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA 
  * Data: “192.168.0.3 is at BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB!”
* Alice and Bob now have each other's MAC which they save in their local Caches
* After exchanging the MACs, Alice and Bob can now communicated with each other directly.

This small exercise of finding MAC of each other's machine is knows as Address Resolution Protocol. Post the resolution the communication between the two machines starts.
