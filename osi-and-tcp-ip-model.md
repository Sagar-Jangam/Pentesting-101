# OSI and TCP/IP model

Both OSI and TCP/IP are models which specifies how data is processed and flows from one node to another. 

**TCP/ IP model**: **** A four layered model, each layer processes the data and passes on to the next one. 

| \# | Name | Protocol/ App |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4 | Application | HTTP, SMTP |
| 3 | Transport | TCP/UDP |
| 2 | Internet | MAC  |
| 1 | Link | RJ45 |

**OSI Model**: A seven layered model, each layer processes the data and passes on to the next one.

| \# | Name  | Protocol/ App |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7 | Application | HTTP, SMTP |
| 6 | Presentation | TLS |
| 5 | Session | SOCKS |
| 4 | Transport | TCP/ UDP |
| 3 | Network | IP routing |
| 2 | Data Link | MAC address |
| 1 | Physical | RJ45 etc. |

#### TCP/UDP 

| TCP \(Transfer Control Protocol\) | UDP \(User Datagram Protocol\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Reliable, acknowledgement is sent | Unreliable, no acknowledgement is sent |
| Re-transmission of packets in case  | Re-transmission isn't available |
| Slow | Fast |
| Sequential | Non Sequential |

#### TCP Handshake \(3 way handshake\) 

| Alice |  | Bob |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| SYN | → |  |
|  | ← | Syn, ACK |
| ACK | → |  |

The handshake is followed by the communication which ends with FIN message.
