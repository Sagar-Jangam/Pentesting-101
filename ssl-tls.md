# SSL/ TLS

Till this point, communication between Alice's server and Bob's client took place in clear-text format. Which, if intercepted by any party could expose information flowing between the two. While working for the government project \(which involved authentication and flow of sensitive information\), Alice realized the short comings of clear-text flow of traffic. Though the government system was in their local network and an outsider couldn't simply intercept the traffic, which wasn't the case with Alice's website. Thus Alice thought of transmitting data in encrypted format and  implemented Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\). SSL, predecessor to TLS, was an encrypted protocol on top of HTTP, together they are called HTTPS  or HTTP over SSL/ TLS. 

As SSL was implemented on top of HTTP, it is possible to encrypt the entire data exposed by HTTP, however, TCP uses the IP address and Port number to make a connection thus IP and Port are left out of encryption scope. A common practice is to leave domain \(or IP address, if used\) name and port out of encryption scope. On the other hand, rest of the data including URL \(baring domain and port\), Query string, Path, Headers, and Body are encrtyped in transit.
