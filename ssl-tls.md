# SSL/ TLS

Till this point, communication between Alice's server and Bob's client took place in clear-text format. Which, if intercepted by any party could expose information flowing between the two. While working for the government project \(which involved authentication and flow of sensitive information\), Alice realized the short comings of clear-text flow of traffic. Though the government system was in their local network and an outsider couldn't simply intercept the traffic, which wasn't the case with Alice's website. Thus Alice thought of transmitting data in encrypted format and  implemented Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\). SSL, predecessor to TLS, was an encryption protocol on top of HTTP, together they are called HTTPS  \(or HTTP over SSL/ TLS\). 

As SSL was implemented on top of HTTP, it is possible to encrypt the entire data exposed by HTTP. However, TCP uses the IP address and Port number to make a connection thus IP and Port can't be encrypted. A common practice is to leave domain \(or IP address, if used\) and port out of encryption scope. On the other hand, rest of the data including URL \(baring domain and port\), Query string, Path, Headers, and Body are encrypted in transit. 

For using encryption in transit, the data should be encrypted and decrypt at both ends of communication. And keeping in mind the intention \(integrity and confidentiality of the data\) Alice came up with a combination of Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is used initially for authentication, further symmetric encryption is used for data transfer \(We will look at this in details in the "Handshake" section\).

Asymmetric encryption means that encryption and decryption of data needs two different keys. In case of HTTPS, the server keeps one of the keys "the private key" with itself and shares the other one with everyone visiting the website "the public key". This allows only the server to decrypt data sent from the client. As asymmetric encryption is only used in initial authentication process, the client doesn't need to have/ share keys for asymmetric encryption \(there are use cases where the client also shares their keys\). Though the server shares its public keys, this can in no way authenticates the server, as anybody on the internet can create a set of public/ private keys. The server has to share more information which is then verified by the client with a independent third party. 

The server shares all the neccessary information in its SSL/ TLS certificate, and the third party to verfiy the authenticity of the server is called a Certificate Authority. Lets look at these and related terms in brief.
