# The Browser & Client-side

**Browser**: We all know what it is. 

**Rendering Engine**: A part of the browser which converts the HTML code accessed from the server to a human-readable/ presentable form. 

**HTML**: HyperText Markup Language, a markup language used for writing web applications, it is used for providing the structure to a web page.

**CSS**: Cascading Style Sheet, another language used for styling the HTML structure of the web page. 

**JavaScript**: A scripting language, used for providing behavior to a web page. JS is mostly used at the client-side of web applications, however, it can also be used at the server-side. 

**DOM**: Document Object Model, represents a document in the form of nodes and objects. It provides a way to define and interact with the web page \(a document\), including altering/ changing the structure, content, and style of the page. 

**Developer Tools**: All popular browsers include a set of developer's tools, these tools provide a way to interact with HTML, CSS & JS of a web page at the runtime. Additionally, developer's tools provide more functionalities such as the flow of requests, access to stored cookies, resource utilization, etc. Visit the [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) to learn more about developer tools.

**Asynchronous requests**:  In a program, if a call is made to an external resource/ program/ library etc. and the program continues with the execution of further statements \(or other blocks\) then these requests are known as asynchronous requests.  

**AJAX**: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of techniques used by web applications to send and fetch data from servers without changing the view of the web page \(or just changing a section of the web page\). Imagine a scoreboard application, just the numbers are updated leaving the rest of the web page the same.   

**Web Sockets**: An application layer protocol, duplex in nature. Unlike HTTP where only the client initiates communication, the server may as well start one. Used for real-time applications where the data keeps on changing in real-time, Chat-bots, Gaming apps, etc.
