#### Client-Server Architecture 

The architecture developed by Alice had a server and a client, this simply is called client-server architecture. The server was responsible for handling the client's request, processing it, and serving a response. And the client was responsible for sending a request, handling the response, and presenting the received data in a human-readable format. The third component, communication channel, though not termed in the architecture name, is an important part of the architecture.

Monolithic/ Single-Process applications such as desktop applications, services, etc, usually do not involve communication over a network, as the entire application \(request and response processing in client-server architecture\) is self-contained. It may communicate with other apps and services on the system but the core of the application is a single unit.

Client-Server applications are also known as two-tier applications, as they have two components \(excluding the communication channel\).

N-tier application, an N-tier application has a presentation layer, middle layer, and a data layer, simply put the data logic \(database/ data processing\) is separated from the business layer, traditionally both are included in the same "serve" layer.
