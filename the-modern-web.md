# The Modern Web

#### Client-Server Architecture 

The architecture developed by Alice had a server and a client, this simply is called client-server architecture. The server was responsible for handling the client's request, processing it \( making decisions & fetching data\), and serving a response. And the client was responsible for sending a request, handling the response, and presenting the received data in a human-readable format. 

Today there are more than one client-server architecture, each architecture performs the basic functions performed by Alice's architecture, however on the basis of segregation of these functions we have classified the architectures. Let's first discuss these functions. 

The **presentation** tier is where the user interacts with the application, consider it the code visible on the browser. 

The **middle** tier \(business logic\) is what the presentation layer and the data layer use to communicate with each other, it contains the code to process client's requests and if needed query the data layer. 

The **data** layer is where the data is stored, it may additionally store the data processing code.

**Monolithic/ Single-Process** applications such as desktop applications, services, etc, usually do not involve communication over a network, as the entire application \(the presentation layer and the data layer\) is self-contained. It may communicate with other apps and services on the system but the core of the application is a single unit.

**Two-tier application**, the original Client-Server applications commonly referred as a **two-tier application**, as these applications involve two components, a presentation layer and a data layer \(excluding the communication channel\). The business logic usually resides in the data layer, however, it may as well reside in the presentation layer or both layers.

**N-tier application**, an N-tier application has a presentation layer, middle layer, and a data layer, simply put the data logic \(database/ data processing\) is separated from the business layer, traditionally both are included in the same \(server in client-server\) layer.

Communication channel, though not termed in the architecture name, is an important part of the architecture as it is of any other network.

The above figure depicts an example web application architecture involving all three tiers and some additional components. A pentester should at least know the functionality of some of these component \(the figure is not an exhuastive one, thus we would go beyond the figure\).

Let's go back to the narrative to understand these components
