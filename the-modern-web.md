# The Modern Web

#### Client-Server Architecture 

The architecture developed by Alice had a server and a client, this simply is called client-server architecture. The server was responsible for handling the client's request, processing it \( making decisions and fetching data\), and serving a response. And the client was responsible for sending a request, handling the response, and presenting the received data in a human-readable format. The third component, communication channel, though not termed in the architecture name, is an important part of the architecture.

The **presentation** tier is where the user interacts with the application, consider it the code visible on your browser. 

The **middle** tier \(business logic\) is what the presentation layer and the data layer use to communicate with each other, it contains the code to process client's requests and if needed query the data layer. 

The **data** layer is where the data is stored, it may additionally store the data processing code.

**Monolithic/ Single-Process** applications such as desktop applications, services, etc, usually do not involve communication over a network, as the entire application \(the presentation layer and the data layer\) is self-contained. It may communicate with other apps and services on the system but the core of the application is a single unit.

**Two-tier application**, the original Client-Server applications commonly referred as a **two-tier application**, as these applications involve two components, a presentation layer and a data layer \(excluding the communication channel\).The business logic usually resides in the data layer, however, it may as well reside in the presentation layer or both layers.

**N-tier application**, an N-tier application has a presentation layer, middle layer, and a data layer, simply put the data logic \(database/ data processing\) is separated from the business layer, traditionally both are included in the same \(server in client-server\) layer.
