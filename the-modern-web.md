#### Client-Server Architecture 

The architecture developed by Alice had a server and a client, this simply is called client-server architecture. The server was responsible for handling the client's request, processing it, and serving a response. And the client was responsible for sending a request, handling the response, and presenting the received data in a human-readable format. The third component, communication channel, though not termed in the architecture name, is an important part of the architecture.

**Monolithic/ Single-Process** applications such as desktop applications, services, etc, usually do not involve communication over a network, as the entire application \(request and response processing in client-server architecture\) is self-contained. It may communicate with other apps and services on the system but the core of the application is a single unit.

Client-Server applications are also known as **two-tier applications**, as they have two components \(excluding the communication channel\).

**N-tier application**, an N-tier application has a presentation layer, middle layer, and a data layer, simply put the data logic \(database/ data processing\) is separated from the business layer, traditionally both are included in the same \(server in client-server\) layer.

The presentation tier is where the user interacts with the application, consider it the code visible on your browser. 

The middle tier is what the presentation layer and the data layer use to communicate with each other, it contains the code to process client's requests and if needed query the data layer. 

The data layer is where the data is stored, it may additionally store the data processing code.
