# The Web

I am going to attempt to simply all these concepts with a story line. A story between two friends Alice and Bob. 

Alice work at a university and Bob works as an engineer. They often share their work between each other, which includes documents and references. However each time one wanted to share an update they had to go through the tedious process of writing the entire document on the email and share it with the other. This process was untidy and tiring, Alice proposed a Hypertext system over the internet, which would allow for Alice to host his content \(text\) along with links \(link difference document together\). Alice thus came up with the following building block for the system: 

1. A server, hosting the files containing the hypertext
2. A client, the browser which will provide a way to present the data at the clients \(Bob\) end
3. A protocol, set of rules for transfer of data between client and server, HTTP
4. A structure/ format for hypertext

This made Bob just write one line request to get the content server by Alice's server. 

GET /Hypertext-Proposal-CERN-1989.html

in response to the the request Bob will see the HTML document containing the Hypertext from the proposal, which would look like. 

&lt;html&gt;A lot of what we are going understand here&lt;/html&gt;

however the browser would use the HTML tags \(&lt;html&gt;\) for rendering the hypertext and only show us "A lot of what we are going to understand here" 

This was simple web, which was ultimately called HTTP 0.9, however as they used the system more they realised it's potential, such as 

* providing more control to the client for editing, uploading, deleting content, 
* decision making by server for different requests by the client, 
* decision making by client corresponding to the response, 
* serving other document types,  
* authentication and authorisation, etc. 

 Alice with other contributors made the system more extensible and usable.
