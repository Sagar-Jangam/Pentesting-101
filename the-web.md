# The Web

I am going to attempt to simply all these concepts with a story line. A story between two friends Alice and Bob.

Alice work at a university and Bob works as an engineer. They often share their work between each other, which includes documents and references. However each time one wanted to share an update they had to go through the tedious process of writing the entire document on the email and share it with the other. This process was untidy and tiring, Alice proposed a Hypertext system over the internet, which would allow for Alice to host his content \(text\) along with links \(link difference document together\). Alice thus came up with the following building block for the system:

1. A server, hosting the files containing the hypertext
2. A client, the browser which will provide a way to present the data at the clients \(Bob\) end
3. A protocol, set of rules for transfer of data between client and server, HTTP
4. A structure/ format for hypertext

This made Bob just write one line request to get the content server by Alice's server.

GET /Hypertext-Proposal-CERN-1989.html

in response to the the request Bob will see the HTML document containing the Hypertext from the proposal, which would look like.

&lt;html&gt;A lot of what we are going understand here&lt;/html&gt;

however the browser would use the HTML tags \(&lt;html&gt;\) for rendering the hypertext and only show us "A lot of what we are going to understand here"

This was simple web, which was ultimately called HTTP 0.9, however as they used the system more they realised it's potential, such as

* providing more control to the client for editing, uploading, deleting content, 
* decision making by server for different requests by the client, 
* decision making by client corresponding to the response, 
* serving other document types,  
* authentication and authorisation, etc.

  Alice with other contributors made the system more extensible and usable. They added more Methods \(POST, HEAD, etc.\), Headers \(Server, User-agent etc.\), compatibility with other documents \(Content Type\), pipelining \(allows you to send second message before the response for first one is server\), content negotiation \(including encoding, language\), SNIs \(Host headers\), Status codes \(200, 404, 302, etc.\), Session management \(Cookies, Cache, etc.\)

The development of the protocol continued and advances concepts were introduces over the time. As it had to security also coght up with the advancements in the protocol and some security specific changes were also introduced \(CORS, Origin, tokens, encryption, Protective headers\). Encryption with HTTPS \(SSL, TLS\) specifically was one of the major developement in the protocol.

Understanding of these concepts is important for any pentesters, I will try to explain some of these and try to link resources for others. So let's continue with our narrative.

#### Methods: 

Bob liked the research idea and the content of the paper, however Bob as usual wrote an email to Alice enclosing his suggestions about the research. This prompted Alice to add features to modify the content served. Thus Alice built the POST method. 

Now Bob could query and get the research paper with a HTTP GET request and upload his feedback with a HTTP POST request. 

Following the back and forth between each other, the document increased in size and introduced a delay in serving. Sometimes, Bob only wanted to check for updates, and loading large document for just to see the same document wasn't helpful. To overcome this Alice introduced the concept of HEAD method, Bob could send a query using this method and check the change in the size of document from last time and GET the document if wanted to in later requests. Same is done today with Caching\(we will come to this later\). 

Now that we have learnt three headers, let's practice: 

Open a terminal, try to locate a testing site \([http://scanme.nmap.org/](http://scanme.nmap.org/) can be used\)

`nc scanme.nmap.org 80/443 (telnet scanme.nmap.org 80/ 443)`

\#Making a HEAD request

`HEAD / HTTP/1.1`

\#Making a GET request

`GET / HTTP/1.1`

Similarly you could make a POST request to a server, the server should be requesting some form of data, which could be send in the body of the request \(as this requires a little more knowledge about HTTP, we will come to this later\).
